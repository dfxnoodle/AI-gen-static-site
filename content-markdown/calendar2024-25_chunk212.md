2 Students admitted by the partner universities under the Collaborative Dual Degree Programmes will pay tuition fee to their home universities. However, they may need to pay other applicable fees to CUHK, including caution money which will be converted into graduation fee eventually.

This sum less any deductions made for outstanding debts shall be refunded on discontinuation or withdrawal of studies at the University. For graduating students, caution money shall be converted into graduation fee, which shall be payable by all students on completion of their studies.
