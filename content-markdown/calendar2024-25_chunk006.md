Academic Structure and Policy
The Chinese University of Hong Kong is a comprehensive research university offering  a wide range of full-time and part-time programmes which lead to bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and doctorates.
There  are  eight  Faculties  (Arts,  Business Administration,  Education, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, and Social Science), and 60 departments/ schools  offering  85  major  programmes  and  76  minor  programmes  for undergraduate students.
Postgraduate programmes including 44 MPhil-PhD programmes, 26 doctoral programmes, 149 master's programmes, seven postgraduate diploma programmes, and one postgraduate certificate programme are offered by the Graduate School through its 60 graduate divisions.
The Senate regulates instruction, education and research. The Faculties advise the Senate through the faculty boards on the programmes of study recommended by the departments/schools, which deliver disciplinary teaching. The Colleges, in turn, support the broader development of students as whole persons in addition to the provision of residential accommodation. All teaching staff and full-time undergraduate students, with a few exception of teachers belonging to research institutes or centres, belong to both a Faculty and to a College.
