New Asia College
New Asia College was founded in 1949 by Mr. Ch'ien Mu and a group of scholars from mainland China. It aims to promote traditional Chinese culture with the complement of Western academics, so that students can deepen their understanding of traditional Chinese culture and at the same time acquire the knowledge and skills needed in modern society.
In  order to  promote cultural exchanges and broaden students' horizons, the College has established a series of study and exchange programmes where students can participate in summer courses or one-term/one-year exchange programmes at world renowned institutions at home or abroad such as Yale University and Peking University.
Each year, the College organises a number of academic and cultural lectures and activities, including the 'Ch'ien Mu Lecture in History and Culture' and the 'Yu Ying-shih Lecture in History'.
A wide range of College scholarships are awarded to students with outstanding performances or improvements in their studies, social services and extra-curricular activities. Bursaries are offered to those with financial difficulties. The College currently has around 3,500 students, and implements the 'Guaranteed One-year Residence Scheme' so that every student has the chance to enjoy hostel life.
