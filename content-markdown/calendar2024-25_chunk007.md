Undergraduate Studies n
At  its  inception  the  University's  undergraduate  curriculum was  based  on  a combination of the credit unit system and the degree examination system. After a comprehensive review in the mid-1980s, the University decided to adopt a pure credit-unit-based curriculum structure. From 1991-92 onwards, greater flexibility was introduced into students' selection of courses and pace of study.
