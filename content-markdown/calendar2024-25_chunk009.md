General Education
General Education plays a vital role in the University's mission to provide a balanced undergraduate education for all students. It equips students with the intellectual capacity for understanding critical issues, ideas, and values of humanity in modern society. It nurtures students to be educated persons capable of making informed judgment and meeting the challenges of the ever-changing world. Providing a firm foundation for the well-rounded intellectual development of students, it prepares them to be lifelong learners and engaged citizens with a global awareness.
The General Education Programme at CUHK is composed of the General Education Foundation, the 'Four Areas' of University General Education, and College General Education. The General Education Foundation and the 'Four Areas' of University General Education are administered by the Office of University General Education, while the College General Education programme is offered by constituent Colleges, each with its distinctive mission and tradition.
