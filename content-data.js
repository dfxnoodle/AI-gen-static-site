            <h4>The Foundation of CUHK</h4>
            <p>The University has its origin in three post-secondary colleges: New Asia College (founded 1949), Chung Chi College (founded 1951), and The United College of Hong Kong (founded 1956), which drew, in their early days, a sizeable proportion of their teachers and some of their students from mainland China.</p>
            
            <p>In 1957, these three Colleges came together to form the Chinese Colleges Joint Council with the objective of securing government recognition of their efforts in providing higher education for the young people of Hong Kong. In 1959, Mr. John S. Fulton (later Lord Fulton of Falmer) was invited to advise on the general lines of development for the three Colleges as a whole.</p>
            
            <h4>Government Recognition</h4>
            <p>In 1960, the government introduced the Post-Secondary Colleges Ordinance and Regulations, which approved financial support to the three Colleges with a view to raising their academic standards.</p>
            
            <p>In 1961, a University Preparatory Committee, chaired by Dr. the Hon. Sir Choy-yu Kwan, was appointed to advise on sites and buildings, and matters relating to the establishment of the University. A group of advisers from Britain and the US visited Hong Kong in the same year to advise the Colleges on the development of university level courses in arts, science, commerce, and social science.</p>
            
            <h4>The Fulton Report</h4>
            <p>The report of these advisers was encouraging, and in 1962 the government appointed a commission under the chairmanship of Mr. John S. Fulton to consider and determine whether and how a Chinese university could be created from the three Colleges.</p>
            
            <p>The Report of the Fulton Commission, known as the Fulton Report and published in April 1963, recommended the establishment of a new university. Shortly after its publication, the Report was approved in principle by the government. A Provisional Council was set up in June 1963, and The Chinese University of Hong Kong Ordinance and Statutes were enacted in September of the same year.</p>
            
            <h4>Official Inauguration</h4>
            <p>On <strong>17 October 1963</strong> the University was formally inaugurated, marking the beginning of CUHK's journey as Hong Kong's second university and the first Chinese-language university in the territory.</p>

        title: 'The Ordinance',
        content: `
            <h4>Constitutional Review</h4>
            <p>In November 1975, the Chancellor of the University appointed an external commission to review the constitutional arrangements governing the University and its constituent Colleges. Lord Fulton of Falmer was again invited to serve as chairman of the commission.</p>
            
            <p>The second Fulton Report was submitted to the Chancellor in March 1976 and published in May. The Report recommended important changes to the constitutional arrangements governing the University and the Colleges.</p>
            
            <h4>New Constitutional Framework</h4>
            <p>Under the new arrangements proposed by the commission, the University would be responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Academic and development policy</li>
                <li>Financial management</li>
                <li>The matriculation of students</li>
                <li>The appointment of staff</li>
                <li>The determination of the curriculum</li>
                <li>The conduct of examinations</li>
                <li>The award of degrees</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Teaching Philosophy</h4>
            <p>The Report recommended that the University should strive to strike a balance between 'subject-orientated' teaching and small group 'student-orientated' teaching, and that the latter should be entrusted to the Colleges. This 'student-orientated' teaching would be designed to build in the students habits and frames of mind required of experts in their chosen fields and to equip them with the necessary skills for meeting new challenges in a rapidly changing world.</p>
            
            <p>A new ordinance to give effect to the recommendations in the second Fulton Report was enacted in <strong>December 1976</strong>.</p>
            
            <h4>Shaw College Establishment</h4>
            <p>In 1986 the University received a generous donation from the Shaw Foundation (Hong Kong) Ltd. for the specific purpose of establishing a fourth College, Shaw College. The Ordinance and the Statutes were further revised to provide for its establishment, and it began admitting students in September 1988.</p>

            <h4>Comprehensive Research University</h4>
            <p>The Chinese University of Hong Kong is a comprehensive research university offering a wide range of full-time and part-time programmes which lead to bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and doctorates.</p>
            
            <h4>Eight Faculties</h4>
            <p>There are eight Faculties offering diverse academic programmes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Faculty of Arts</strong> - Humanities and cultural studies</li>
                <li><strong>Faculty of Business Administration</strong> - Business and management</li>
                <li><strong>Faculty of Education</strong> - Educational studies and teacher training</li>
                <li><strong>Faculty of Engineering</strong> - Engineering and technology</li>
                <li><strong>Faculty of Law</strong> - Legal studies</li>
                <li><strong>Faculty of Medicine</strong> - Medical and health sciences</li>
                <li><strong>Faculty of Science</strong> - Natural and mathematical sciences</li>
                <li><strong>Faculty of Social Science</strong> - Social sciences and humanities</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Academic Programmes</h4>
            <p>The University offers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>60 departments/schools</strong> delivering specialized education</li>
                <li><strong>85 major programmes</strong> for undergraduate students</li>
                <li><strong>76 minor programmes</strong> for undergraduate students</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Governance Structure</h4>
            <p>The Senate regulates instruction, education and research. The Faculties advise the Senate through the faculty boards on the programmes of study recommended by the departments/schools, which deliver disciplinary teaching. The Colleges, in turn, support the broader development of students as whole persons in addition to the provision of residential accommodation.</p>
            
            <p>All teaching staff and full-time undergraduate students, with a few exceptions of teachers belonging to research institutes or centres, belong to both a Faculty and to a College.</p>

            <h4>Curriculum Evolution</h4>
            <p>At its inception the University's undergraduate curriculum was based on a combination of the credit unit system and the degree examination system. After a comprehensive review in the mid-1980s, the University decided to adopt a pure credit-unit-based curriculum structure. From 1991-92 onwards, greater flexibility was introduced into students' selection of courses and pace of study.</p>
            
            <h4>New Programmes for 2024-25</h4>
            <p>Throughout the years the University has endeavoured to provide a wide variety of programmes to meet the changing needs of society. In 2024-25, one major and three minor programmes are introduced:</p>
