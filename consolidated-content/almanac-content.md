Undergraduate Studies n
At  its  inception  the  University's  undergraduate  curriculum was  based  on  a combination of the credit unit system and the degree examination system. After a comprehensive review in the mid-1980s, the University decided to adopt a pure credit-unit-based curriculum structure. From 1991-92 onwards, greater flexibility was introduced into students' selection of courses and pace of study.

Full-time Undergraduate Studies
Throughout the years the University has endeavoured to provide a wide variety of programmes to meet the changing needs of society. In 2024-25, one major and three minor programmes are introduced.

General Education
General Education plays a vital role in the University's mission to provide a balanced undergraduate education for all students. It equips students with the intellectual capacity for understanding critical issues, ideas, and values of humanity in modern society. It nurtures students to be educated persons capable of making informed judgment and meeting the challenges of the ever-changing world. Providing a firm foundation for the well-rounded intellectual development of students, it prepares them to be lifelong learners and engaged citizens with a global awareness.
The General Education Programme at CUHK is composed of the General Education Foundation, the 'Four Areas' of University General Education, and College General Education. The General Education Foundation and the 'Four Areas' of University General Education are administered by the Office of University General Education, while the College General Education programme is offered by constituent Colleges, each with its distinctive mission and tradition.

Postgraduate Studies n
Master's programmes were first offered in 1966-67, and the number of programmes in  2024-25 is 149. Doctoral programmes were first introduced in 1980-81 and the number of programmes is 26 in 2024-25. MPhil-PhD programmes were first introduced in 2004-05, and the number of programmes is 44 in 2024-25.
