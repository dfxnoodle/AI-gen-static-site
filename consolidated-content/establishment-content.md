General Information

Origin
The University has its origin in three post-secondary colleges: New Asia College (founded 1949), Chung Chi College (founded 1951), and The United College of Hong Kong (founded 1956), which drew, in their early days, a sizeable proportion of their teachers and some of their students from mainland China.
In 1957, these three Colleges came together to form the Chinese Colleges Joint Council with the objective of securing government recognition of their efforts in providing higher education for the young people of Hong Kong. In 1959, Mr. John S. Fulton (later Lord Fulton of Falmer) was invited to advise on the general lines of development for the three Colleges as a whole. In 1960, the government introduced the Post-Secondary Colleges Ordinance and Regulations, which approved financial support to the three Colleges with a view to raising their academic standards.
In 1961, a University Preparatory Committee, chaired by Dr. the Hon. Sir Choyiu Kwan, was appointed to advise on sites and buildings, and matters relating to the establishment of the University. A group of advisers from Britain and the US visited Hong Kong in the same year to advise the Colleges on the development of university level courses in arts, science, commerce, and social science. The report of these advisers was encouraging, and in 1962 the government appointed a  commission under the chairmanship of Mr. John S. Fulton to consider and determine whether and how a Chinese university could be created from the three Colleges.
The Report of the Fulton Commission, known as the Fulton Report and published in April 1963, recommended the establishment of a new university. Shortly  after  its  publication,  the Report was  approved  in  principle  by  the government. A Provisional Council was set up in June 1963, and The Chinese University of Hong Kong Ordinance and Statutes were enacted in September of the same year. On 17 October 1963 the University was formally inaugurated.

The Ordinance
In  November 1975, the Chancellor of the University appointed an external commission to review the constitutional arrangements governing the University and its constituent Colleges. Lord Fulton of Falmer was again invited to serve as chairman of the commission.
The second Fulton Report was submitted to the Chancellor in March 1976 and published in May. The Report recommended important changes to the constitutional arrangements governing the University and the Colleges. Under the  new arrangements proposed by the commission, the University would be responsible for academic and development policy, financial management, the matriculation of students, the appointment of staff, the determination of the curriculum, the conduct of examinations, and the award of degrees. The participation of senior academics in the governing bodies of the University would be strengthened. In addition, the Report recommended that the University should strive to strike a balance between 'subject-orientated' teaching and small group 'student-orientated' teaching, and that the latter should be entrusted to the Colleges. This 'student-orientated' teaching would be designed to build in the students habits and frames of mind required of experts in their chosen fields and to equip them with the necessary skills for meeting new challenges in a rapidly changing world. A new ordinance to give effect to the recommendations in the second Fulton Report was enacted in December 1976.
In  1986  the  University  received  a  generous  donation  from  the  Shaw Foundation (Hong Kong) Ltd. for the specific purpose of establishing a fourth College, Shaw College. The Ordinance and the Statutes were further revised to provide for its establishment, and it began admitting students in September 1988.
The University cherishes its college system and the vital roles played by its constituent Colleges. To cater for the addition of more than 3,000 undergraduate students upon reversion to a four-year undergraduate curriculum in 2012, the University decided to establish more Colleges. With very generous support from a number of patrons, the University established Morningside College and S.H. Ho College in May 2006, C.W. Chu College and Wu Yee Sun College in May 2007, and Lee Woo Sing College in October 2007. In July 2007, the University has by Ordinance, in accordance with a special resolution of the Council, declared Morningside College and S.H. Ho College as constituent Colleges of the University. In February 2008, an Ordinance for the declaration of C.W. Chu College, Wu Yee Sun College, and Lee Woo Sing College as constituent Colleges of the University was enacted by the Legislative Council.
The Ordinance and the Statutes of the University are printed in Part 1 of this Calendar .

Academic Structure and Policy
The Chinese University of Hong Kong is a comprehensive research university offering  a wide range of full-time and part-time programmes which lead to bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and doctorates.
There  are  eight  Faculties  (Arts,  Business Administration,  Education, Engineering, Law, Medicine, Science, and Social Science), and 60 departments/ schools  offering  85  major  programmes  and  76  minor  programmes  for undergraduate students.
Postgraduate programmes including 44 MPhil-PhD programmes, 26 doctoral programmes, 149 master's programmes, seven postgraduate diploma programmes, and one postgraduate certificate programme are offered by the Graduate School through its 60 graduate divisions.
The Senate regulates instruction, education and research. The Faculties advise the Senate through the faculty boards on the programmes of study recommended by the departments/schools, which deliver disciplinary teaching. The Colleges, in turn, support the broader development of students as whole persons in addition to the provision of residential accommodation. All teaching staff and full-time undergraduate students, with a few exception of teachers belonging to research institutes or centres, belong to both a Faculty and to a College.

The Constituent Colleges
With the reorganisation of the  University  following  the  enactment  of The Chinese University of Hong Kong Ordinance 1976, the Boards of Trustees of the three original Colleges, viz. Chung Chi College, New Asia College, and The United College of Hong Kong, were reconstituted. Each college board is mainly concerned with the management of the movable property and of certain College buildings entrusted to it, as well as the promotion of scholastic and cultural activities of the College.
Each College is governed by an Assembly of Fellows chaired by the College Head/Master, and this assembly is responsible for making and implementing decisions on various matters relating to the College.
In January 1986 the University received a very generous donation from the Shaw Foundation (Hong Kong) Ltd. for the establishment of Shaw College with Sir Run Run Shaw as its patron. The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Declaration of Shaw College) Ordinance was enacted in July 1986. Shaw College admitted its first batch of students in 1988.
In  2006,  the  University  received  very  generous  donations  from  the Morningside Foundation and Morningside Education Foundation Ltd., and from The S.H. Ho Foundation Ltd. in support of its visions to enhance the collegiate system in anticipation of the surge in undergraduate enrolment in 2012 when the University reverts to a normative four-year curriculum. In May the same year, the University Council endorsed the establishing of two new Colleges and named them respectively Morningside College and S.H. Ho College.
In May 2007, C.W. Chu College and Wu Yee Sun College were established with generous donations from benefactors and Wu Yee Sun Charitable Foundation Ltd., respectively.
In October 2007, the University Council further approved the establishment of  Lee Woo Sing College with very generous support from the Li Foundation (Bing Hua Tang).
To give legal effect to the establishment of the five new Colleges, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Declaration of Morningside College and S.H. Ho College as Constituent Colleges) Ordinance was enacted in July 2007, and The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Declaration of C.W. Chu College, Wu Yee Sun College and Lee Woo Sing College as Constituent Colleges) Ordinance was enacted in February 2008.

Chung Chi College
Chung Chi College was founded in 1951 by representatives of Protestant Churches in Hong Kong, inheriting the educational mission of the 13 Christian universities in mainland China. The College moved to its permanent site in Ma Liu Shui in 1956 and was incorporated as one of the constituent Colleges of CUHK in 1963.
Integrating Christianity and Chinese cultures, the College endeavours to cultivate love for humanity, freedom and inclusiveness, nurture talent with insightful knowledge, a liberal attitude and global horizon. The College organises diversified local and overseas experiential learning programmes, ranging from art and culture, language study, to career development, community service and leadership. The College General Education, which includes the Service-Learning Programme and the Exploration and Discovery Study Scheme, etc., fosters thinking and learning from multiple perspectives, and extends students' horizon stretching beyond the scope of their major and minor studies. Moreover, scholarships are set up to recognise students' outstanding achievements in academics and balanced education, etc., while the award schemes promote their creativity and potential exploration.
Situated near the MTR station, the campus was designed in a manner that blends with its beautiful natural surroundings. Elements of Christian traditions and heritage as well as the liberal attitude and respect to diverse religions are found. Chung Chi's motto In Pursuit of Excellence means the continuous strive to improve themselves for serving the society in the best way possible.

Lee Woo Sing College
Lee Woo Sing College was established in 2007 with very generous support from the Li Foundation (Bing Hua Tang).
The motto of Lee Woo Sing College, Wisdom, Humanity, Integrity, Harmony highlights the cultivation of virtue and pursuit of knowledge. The emblem of the College is made up of three ancient Chinese characterspeople, mountain , and harmony which embraces nurturing leaders, emphasising the interaction with the nature, and maintaining a harmonious culture. The College provides various experiential learning opportunities to facilitate the whole-person development of students. It includes a wide-range of interdisciplinary and student-oriented general education courses, various academic and cultural co-curricular activities, such as overseas exchange and mentorship programmes.
The College's beautiful campus is commanding the tranquil view of Tolo Harbour. The idea of the campus design is to make the buildings blend in with the nature. The campus implements advanced technologies, such as an integrated security system. There are comprehensive learning and leisure facilities, and four catering outlets on campus.
To advocate the importance of green life and sustainability, the College has implemented a number of new energy-saving technologies and measures on campus, such as the installation of the first Hong Kong Smart Meter with mobile energy monitoring app, a high-efficiency CIGS solar energy system and fresh air systems. Besides, the College's Green Ambassador Programme help to raise students' awareness of protecting the environment.
